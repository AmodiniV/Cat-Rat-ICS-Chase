# Cat-Rat-ICS-Chase
Welcome to a cybersecurity twist on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe! But this isn't your ordinary Tic Tac Toe; it's a game designed to teach everyone, especially those interested in Industrial Control Systems, about essential security concepts.

**How to Play:**

You can go solo or team up with friends. In single-player mode, you face off against the device, which acts as the defender and throws random security practices your way. In multiplayer, one of you plays as the attacker, and the other is the defender.

**The Game's Three Exciting Levels:**

We've divided the game into three intriguing levels: the Public-Facing Network, the Internal IT Network, and the ICS Systems.
As the attacker, your mission is to navigate through the levels, starting with basic Level 1 attacks and progressing deeper into the heart of the ICS layer.

**Watch Your Step:**

At every stage of your hacking adventure, the game will keep you on your toes. It'll let you know if your attack was a success or a flop. An attack fails when the security measure is already in place before you strike.

**Plan Your Moves:**

The attacker can strategize their moves based on the security measures at each layer. Try different tactics and methods to break through!
Once you've successfully hacked your way into the ICS system, you'll receive a notification, along with the number of days it took you to master the art of the attack.

**Ready to Dive In?**

All it takes to get started is a simple command: 'python cip_game.py.'

**Author's Note:**

This is just the first draft of the game, aimed at making cybersecurity concepts fun and intuitive. Stay tuned for updates as we link various security practices to enhance the gameplay!"
